Requirements
=============
1. Apache
2. PHP5.4+
3. Some knowledge of PHP (expert knowledge isnt required)

Creating your first application follow these steps (Simple as 1-2-3):
======================================================================

Download this repo and extract so you have a folder named "zedek" or what ever else you want to call it in a non web accessible folder (one of the security features of Zedek Framework). You can either download the zip file or easier clone 

	git clone https://github.com/djynnius/ZedekFramework.git

For those comfortable with composer you can install with the command:

    composer create-project openimo/zedekframework

set persmissions to allow reading and writing to zedekframework folder

Change directory into your zedekframework folder and run :

    php zedek start

on windows replace php with the path to the php binary - example:
	
	c:\xampp\php\php.exe zedek start


You are done! view your app on localhost:8585

You can now view your application on localhost:8585


Hello World!
============

Zedek 6 is built to map urls to engine directories and methods of the class CController (for current controller) in a style:

    http://localhost:8585/controller/method/id/?arg1=val1&arg2=val2...$argn=valn

(this mapping is handled primarily by a class named URLMaper) 

No routing files are required.

The MVC is made literal within the engine folder. 

1. To create a new app named foo create a folder with the name foo within the engines folder.
2. within this create a class file "controller.php".

next within the controller file enter the following code inside your php tags

    <?php
    namespace __zf__;
    class CController extends ZController{
        function bar(){
            print "Hello World";
        }
    }
    

3. Browse to http://localhost:8585/foo/bar

and you should see your hello world message!

Congratulations!
