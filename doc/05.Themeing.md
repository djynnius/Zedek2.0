#05. Themeing#

The themes are located in the public folder in a folder named themes and contain 2 files and relevant folder(s):

    header.html
    footer.html
    relevant_folder(s)/

The theme may be selected by setting within the config file /zedek/config/global.config

    {
        "theme": "new_theme"
    }

this would then require that a new theme folder with the name new_theme is created within the themes folder.

Templating applies to the theme, thus allowing for place holders within the header and footer files.

##Linking style and script##

To access files in the themes folder use the {{theme}} placeholder that maps to the default themes folder eg

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{theme}}/css/style.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{theme}}/js/jquery.js"></script>
    <img src="{{theme}}/images/avater.jpg">

when linking to an alternate theme use the {{dir}} placeholder that maps to the web folder eg:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{dir}}/themes/theme_name/css/style.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{dir}}/themes/theme_name/js/jquery.js"></script>
    <img src="{{dir}}/themes/theme_name/images/avater.jpg">
