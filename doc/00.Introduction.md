Zedek Framework is a PHP web development Framework. It is built to be a very light framework and very powerful.

Zedek Framework was first developed in 2011 and has progressed since then. In its first version (0.1 to 4.0.0) the basic idea was laid but had to be improved on in several areas.

Zedek Framework is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework; Object Oriented; Encourages agile development; has included in it an Object Relational Model (ZORM); a templating engine accessed from a class called ZView; Templating engines allowing basic conditionals; URL rewriting allowing for clean urls. The framework is in 2 parts for enhanced security - the web component and the non web.

The web component allowed for one or more public folders for uploads of all web accessible objects particularly those required for theming such as images, stylesheets, javascripts etc. The second part of the framework, the non web component handles all the core functionality of the framework.

Requirements for using the framework include PHP5.4+ ; basic knowledge of PHP; and Knowledge of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - this tool may also help improve on your OOP skills! Test Driven Development with Simpletest was also been included.

In version 3.0 new features were included:
